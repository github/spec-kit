# Validation Framework

This directory contains validation patterns, quality gates, and checklists used throughout the Spec Kit development process. These resources ensure consistency, quality, and constitutional compliance across all development phases.

## Purpose

The validation framework provides:
- **Quality Gates**: Checkpoints that must pass before proceeding to the next phase
- **Review Checklists**: Comprehensive checklists for code and document reviews
- **Validation Patterns**: Reusable validation logic for common scenarios
- **Compliance Checks**: Constitutional principle verification

## Structure

- **quality-gates.md**: Core quality gates used throughout the development process
- **review-checklist.md**: Comprehensive review checklists for different types of work
- **validation-patterns.md**: Common validation patterns and their implementation
- **constitutional-compliance.md**: Detailed constitutional principle checks

## Integration Points

### With Commands
- `/validate` command uses patterns from this directory
- `/review` command references review checklists
- `/specify` and `/plan` commands use quality gates

### With Templates
- Spec and plan templates reference these validation criteria
- Templates include validation checkpoints that align with these patterns

### With Development Workflow
- Pre-commit hooks can reference validation patterns
- CI/CD pipelines can implement these quality gates
- Pull request templates can include relevant checklists

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Choose Appropriate Validation**: Select validation patterns that match the work being done
2. **Apply Systematically**: Use checklists consistently across similar work
3. **Adapt as Needed**: Modify patterns for project-specific requirements
4. **Update Regularly**: Keep validation patterns current with project evolution

## Customization

Projects can extend these patterns by:
- Adding project-specific quality gates
- Creating domain-specific validation patterns
- Customizing review checklists for team preferences
- Adding automated validation scripts

Remember: Validation frameworks are tools for improvement, not barriers to progress. Use them to enhance quality while maintaining development velocity.
