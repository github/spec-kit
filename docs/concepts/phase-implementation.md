# Phase 3: Implementation

Building according to the plan, validating against the spec.

## What is Implementation?

Converting the specification and plan into working, tested code.

## The Implementation Process

1. **Create task breakdown** - `/tasks` generates actionable items
2. **Implement systematically** - Follow the plan, create according to spec
3. **Test continuously** - Validate against acceptance criteria
4. **Submit for review** - Code review validates against spec and plan

## Validation

Implementation is validated by:
- **Unit tests** - Individual functions work correctly
- **Integration tests** - Components work together
- **Acceptance tests** - Feature meets spec criteria
- **Code review** - Implementation matches plan

## Implementation Guidelines

- Follow the implementation plan step-by-step
- Write tests as you code, not after
- Validate against acceptance criteria frequently
- Commit atomically with clear messages
- Reference spec and plan in commit messages

## Code Review Focus

Code reviewers check:
- ✅ Does implementation match the spec?
- ✅ Does it follow the technical plan?
- ✅ Are acceptance criteria met?
- ✅ Are tests comprehensive?
- ✅ Is code quality high?

## Common Issues

**Code doesn't match spec**
- Implementation went off plan
- Spec or plan was ambiguous
- Requirements misunderstood

Solution: Update spec/plan or adjust code accordingly.

**Architecture doesn't match plan**
- Discovered issues during implementation
- Plan was incomplete

Solution: Update plan, discuss changes, proceed with agreement.

## Output

- ✅ Working implementation
- ✅ Comprehensive tests
- ✅ Git history tracing changes
- ✅ PR with clear description linking to spec/plan
