# Issue-Resolution Flow with Spec Kit

Issue-Resolution Flow is a structured approach to bug fixing, improvements, and issue resolution using the same principles as Spec-Driven Development. It provides a systematic way to investigate, plan, and resolve issues while maintaining the same quality standards as feature development.

## Overview

Issue-Resolution Flow extends the Spec Kit workflow to handle:
- **Bug Reports**: Systematic investigation and resolution of software defects
- **Improvements**: Enhancement requests and optimization opportunities  
- **Technical Debt**: Refactoring and code quality improvements
- **Performance Issues**: Investigation and resolution of performance problems
- **Security Issues**: Vulnerability assessment and remediation

## The Issue-Resolution Flow

### 1. Create Issue Specification (`/issue`)

Start by creating a structured issue specification that clearly defines the problem:

```bash
/issue The user dashboard is not loading properly. When users click on the dashboard link, they see a blank page instead of their data. This happens consistently for all users and started after the last deployment.
```

**What it creates:**
- `issues/###-issue-name/issue.md` - Structured issue specification
- Problem statement and impact assessment
- Current vs expected behavior
- Reproduction steps
- Issue requirements and constraints

**Key sections in the issue specification:**
- **Problem Statement & Impact**: Clear description of what's broken
- **Current Behavior**: What is actually happening
- **Expected Behavior**: What should be happening
- **Impact Assessment**: User, business, and system impact
- **Reproduction Steps**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Issue Requirements**: Functional requirements for the fix

### 2. Plan Issue Resolution (`/plan`)

Create a technical implementation plan for resolving the issue:

```bash
/plan Investigate the dashboard loading issue by checking the API endpoints, database connections, and frontend routing. Implement proper error handling and logging to prevent similar issues in the future.
```

**What it creates:**
- Technical investigation plan
- Root cause analysis approach
- Implementation strategy for the fix
- Testing and validation plan
- Prevention measures

**Planning focuses on:**
- **Investigation Strategy**: How to identify the root cause
- **Fix Implementation**: Technical approach to resolve the issue
- **Testing Plan**: How to validate the fix works
- **Prevention**: Measures to prevent similar issues

### 3. Generate Resolution Tasks (`/tasks`)

Create an actionable task list for issue resolution:

```bash
/tasks
```

**Task categories for issue resolution:**
- **Investigation Tasks**: Debugging, logging analysis, root cause identification
- **Fix Implementation**: Code changes, configuration updates, data fixes
- **Testing Tasks**: Unit tests, integration tests, regression tests
- **Validation Tasks**: User acceptance testing, performance validation
- **Documentation Tasks**: Update documentation, create runbooks

### 4. Execute Issue Resolution (`/resolve`)

Execute the issue resolution plan:

```bash
/resolve
```

**The resolve command:**
- Validates prerequisites (issue spec, plan, tasks)
- Executes tasks in dependency order
- Follows investigation → fix → test → validate approach
- Provides progress updates and error handling
- Marks completed tasks in the tasks file

## Key Differences from Feature Development

| Aspect | Feature Development | Issue-Resolution Flow |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **Directory** | `specs/###-feature-name/` | `issues/###-issue-name/` |
| **Focus** | What to build | What's broken |
| **Template** | `spec-template.md` | `issue-template.md` |
| **Approach** | Requirements → Implementation | Problem → Investigation → Fix |
| **Tasks** | Build new functionality | Debug, fix, test, validate |
| **Validation** | Feature acceptance | Issue resolution confirmation |

## Best Practices

### Writing Good Issue Descriptions

**Do:**
- Be specific about the problem
- Include reproduction steps
- Describe expected vs actual behavior
- Mention when the issue started
- Include error messages or screenshots

**Don't:**
- Include solution details (save for planning phase)
- Be vague about the problem scope
- Mix multiple unrelated issues
- Skip reproduction steps

### Effective Issue Resolution Planning

**Investigation First:**
- Start with logging and debugging
- Identify the root cause before implementing fixes
- Use systematic debugging approaches
- Document findings during investigation

**Fix Implementation:**
- Implement minimal changes to resolve the issue
- Consider broader implications of the fix
- Ensure the fix doesn't introduce new issues
- Include proper error handling

**Testing and Validation:**
- Test the fix thoroughly
- Verify the issue is completely resolved
- Check for regressions in related functionality
- Validate performance impact

## Examples

### Bug Fix Example

**Issue Description:**
```
/issue Users are unable to upload files larger than 10MB. The upload progress bar shows 100% but then displays an error message "Upload failed" without any specific error details. This affects all file types and started after the recent server update.
```

**Resolution Plan:**
```
/plan Investigate the file upload issue by checking server logs, upload limits, and error handling. The issue likely relates to server configuration changes or timeout settings. Implement proper error messages and logging to help diagnose future upload issues.
```

### Performance Issue Example

**Issue Description:**
```
/issue The user dashboard takes 15+ seconds to load, compared to the previous 2-3 seconds. Users are reporting timeouts and poor user experience. This started after adding the new analytics widgets to the dashboard.
```

**Resolution Plan:**
```
/plan Investigate the dashboard performance regression by analyzing database queries, API response times, and frontend rendering. Focus on the new analytics widgets and their data loading patterns. Implement caching and optimization strategies.
```

### Security Issue Example

**Issue Description:**
```
/issue Security scan detected potential SQL injection vulnerability in the user search functionality. The search endpoint appears to be constructing queries dynamically without proper parameterization.
```

**Resolution Plan:**
```
/plan Investigate the SQL injection vulnerability by reviewing the search endpoint code and database query construction. Implement parameterized queries and input validation. Add security testing to prevent similar issues.
```

## Integration with Existing Workflows

Issue-Resolution Flow integrates seamlessly with existing Spec Kit workflows:

- **Use existing `/plan` and `/tasks` commands** for the planning and task generation phases
- **Leverage the same AI agents** and command structure
- **Follow the same quality standards** and documentation requirements
- **Use the same project structure** with issues stored in `issues/` directory

## Getting Started

1. **Identify an issue** that needs resolution
2. **Run `/issue`** with a clear problem description
3. **Review the generated issue specification** and refine if needed
4. **Run `/plan`** to create a resolution strategy
5. **Run `/tasks`** to generate actionable tasks
6. **Run `/resolve`** to execute the resolution plan

Issue-Resolution Flow provides a structured, systematic approach to resolving issues while maintaining the same high standards as feature development in the Spec Kit ecosystem.
