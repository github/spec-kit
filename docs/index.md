# Spec Kit Documentation

Welcome to the Spec Kit documentation! Spec Kit helps you build high-quality software faster through Spec-Driven Development.

## What is Spec-Driven Development?

Spec-Driven Development **flips the script** on traditional software development. Instead of jumping straight to code, you create executable specifications that drive implementation. The specification becomes your source of truth.

- **Tutorials** (Getting Started) - Learning by doing
- **How-to Guides** (Guides) - Solving specific problems
- **Explanations** (Concepts) - Understanding the system
- **Reference** - Technical specifications

Each section serves a different purpose, so you can find exactly what you need.
