# Payment System Specification

## Overview
This specification defines the payment workflow integration with Stripe for the printing services marketplace, enabling secure transactions between customers and brokers.

## Payment Workflow

### Customer Accepts Proposal and Initiates Payment
```gherkin
Given a logged-in verified customer
And a proposal exists for their request
When they accept the proposal
Then the system creates a Stripe checkout session
And redirects customer to secure payment page
And creates a pending transaction record
And proposal status becomes "ACCEPTED"
And request status becomes "APPROVED"
```

### Successful Payment Processing
```gherkin
Given a customer completes Stripe checkout successfully
When Stripe webhook confirms payment
Then transaction status updates to "PAID"
And request status updates to "COMPLETED"
And broker receives payment confirmation email
And customer receives job confirmation email
And funds are held in escrow (future: smart contract)
```

### Payment Failure Handling
```gherkin
Given a customer initiates payment
When payment fails or is cancelled
Then transaction remains "PENDING"
And request status reverts to "PROPOSED"
And customer receives failure notification
And broker is notified of payment issue
And customer can retry payment
```

### Payment Cancellation
```gherkin
Given a customer at Stripe checkout page
When they click cancel or close browser
Then they return to dashboard with cancellation message
And no charges are made
And proposal remains accepted but unpaid
And customer can retry payment later
```

## Transaction Management

### Transaction Record Creation
```gherkin
Given a proposal acceptance triggers payment
When Stripe session is created
Then system creates transaction record with:
  - Unique transaction ID
  - Proposal ID reference
  - Stripe session ID
  - Amount from proposal price
  - Status "PENDING"
  - Customer and broker information
  - Timestamp of creation
```

### Transaction Status Lifecycle
```gherkin
Given a transaction exists
When initially created
Then status is "PENDING"
When payment completes successfully
Then status becomes "PAID"
When payment fails permanently
Then status becomes "FAILED"
When refund is processed
Then status becomes "REFUNDED"
```

### Transaction History and Audit
```gherkin
Given completed transactions exist
When customer views their transaction history
Then they see all their payments with details
When broker views their earnings
Then they see payments for their accepted proposals
When admin views transaction logs
Then they see all platform transactions with full audit trail
```

## Stripe Integration

### Checkout Session Configuration
```gherkin
Given a proposal acceptance
When creating Stripe checkout session
Then session includes:
  - Line item with proposal price
  - Product name from request title
  - Customer email pre-filled
  - Success URL to dashboard with session ID
  - Cancel URL to dashboard with cancellation flag
  - Metadata with proposal and request IDs
  - Payment methods: card only (initially)
```

### Webhook Event Handling
```gherkin
Given Stripe sends webhook events
When "checkout.session.completed" event received
Then system verifies webhook signature
And updates transaction status to "PAID"
And updates request status to "COMPLETED"
And sends confirmation emails
When "payment_intent.payment_failed" event received
Then system updates transaction status to "FAILED"
And notifies customer of failure
```

### Test Mode Configuration
```gherkin
Given development environment
When processing payments
Then use Stripe test mode keys
And accept test card numbers only
And no real money is charged
And all transactions are clearly marked as test
```

## Security and Validation

### Payment Amount Validation
```gherkin
Given a proposal with price
When creating checkout session
Then amount matches proposal price exactly
And currency is set to USD
And amount is converted to cents correctly
And no manipulation of price is possible
```

### Webhook Security
```gherkin
Given Stripe webhook endpoint
When receiving webhook events
Then verify Stripe signature header
And reject unsigned requests with 400 error
And log all webhook attempts for audit
And process only verified events
```

### Transaction Integrity
```gherkin
Given transaction processing
When any step fails
Then system maintains data consistency
And no partial transactions are created
And failed attempts are logged
And user receives clear error messages
```

## User Experience

### Payment Flow UX
```gherkin
Given customer accepts proposal
When payment modal opens
Then show clear pricing breakdown
And display broker information
And show secure payment badges
And provide clear next steps
And handle loading states gracefully
```

### Payment Success Experience
```gherkin
Given successful payment completion
When customer returns from Stripe
Then show success confirmation message
And display transaction details
And show estimated completion timeline
And provide broker contact information
And offer to download receipt
```

### Payment Failure Experience
```gherkin
Given payment failure occurs
When customer returns to platform
Then show clear error message
And explain reason for failure
And provide retry payment option
And offer alternative payment methods
And show support contact information
```

## Email Notifications

### Payment Confirmation Emails
```gherkin
Given successful payment
When transaction completes
Then send email to customer with:
  - Payment confirmation
  - Transaction details
  - Project timeline
  - Broker contact information
And send email to broker with:
  - New job notification
  - Customer contact details
  - Project specifications
  - Payment confirmation
```

### Payment Failure Notifications
```gherkin
Given payment failure
When transaction fails
Then send email to customer with:
  - Failure notification
  - Reason for failure
  - Retry payment link
  - Support contact information
And send email to broker with:
  - Payment issue notification
  - Customer contact for follow-up
```

## API Endpoints

### Payment Endpoints
```gherkin
Given payment API endpoints
When POST /api/proposals/:id/accept with customer auth
Then return 200 with Stripe checkout URL
When GET /api/transactions with customer auth
Then return 200 with customer's transaction history
When GET /api/transactions with broker auth
Then return 200 with broker's earnings history
When GET /api/transactions with admin auth
Then return 200 with all platform transactions
```

### Webhook Endpoints
```gherkin
Given webhook endpoints
When POST /api/webhook/stripe with valid signature
Then return 200 and process event
When POST /api/webhook/stripe with invalid signature
Then return 400 and reject request
When POST /api/webhook/stripe with unknown event
Then return 200 and log event for review
```

## Error Handling

### Stripe API Errors
```gherkin
Given Stripe API calls
When API key is invalid
Then return 500 with "Payment service unavailable"
When rate limit exceeded
Then return 429 with "Too many requests"
When network timeout occurs
Then return 500 with "Payment service timeout"
```

### Database Transaction Errors
```gherkin
Given database operations during payment
When transaction creation fails
Then rollback all changes
And return 500 with generic error message
And log detailed error for debugging
And notify administrators of issue
```

## Performance Requirements

### Response Times
- Checkout session creation: < 2 seconds
- Webhook processing: < 1 second
- Transaction history loading: < 1 second
- Payment status updates: Real-time via webhooks

### Reliability
- 99.9% uptime for payment processing
- Webhook retry mechanism for failed deliveries
- Graceful degradation when Stripe is unavailable
- Automatic reconciliation of payment status

## Compliance and Security

### Data Protection
- PCI DSS compliance through Stripe
- No storage of card details on platform
- Encrypted transaction metadata
- GDPR compliant data handling

### Financial Regulations
- Proper tax calculation (future enhancement)
- Transaction reporting capabilities
- Refund processing workflows
- Dispute resolution procedures

## Testing Strategy

### Test Scenarios
```gherkin
Given test environment
When running payment tests
Then use Stripe test cards:
  - 4242424242424242 (success)
  - 4000000000000002 (decline)
  - 4000000000009995 (insufficient funds)
And verify all status transitions
And confirm email notifications
And validate webhook processing
```

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end payment flow testing
- Webhook event simulation
- Error condition testing
- Performance load testing
- Security penetration testing
