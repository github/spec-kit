2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/spec-kit.git`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comprehensive JSDoc comments for public APIs

- Use Jest testing framework with provided setup

### Commit Messages
Follow conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

Examples:
- `feat(hub): add workflow execution history`
- `fix(tab): handle missing work item fields`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`

## üîß Architecture Guidelines

### Service Layer Design

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
```bash
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:watch         # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage      # Coverage report
```

### Integration Tests
