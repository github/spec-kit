# Spec Kit Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Azure DevOps extension:

## Required Icons:
- `icon.png` - 128x128 pixels - Main extension icon
- `icon-large.png` - 256x256 pixels - Large extension icon for marketplace

## Icon Guidelines:
- Use PNG format with transparency
- Follow Azure DevOps visual design guidelines
- Use Spec Kit branding colors and logo
- Ensure visibility on both light and dark backgrounds

## Placeholder Notice:
The actual icon files need to be created by a designer and added to this directory.
For development purposes, you can use any 128x128 PNG file renamed to `icon.png`.

## Creating Icons:
1. Design 256x256 pixel icon in your graphics software
2. Export as PNG with transparency
3. Create 128x128 version for main icon
4. Place both files in this assets directory
5. Update vss-extension.json if needed
