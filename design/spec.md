# Spec-Driven Development

This project follows **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)**.

*   **Spec Definition**: All features and changes should start with a clear specification.
*   **Design Directory**: This directory serves as the living documentation of the system's design, derived from the specs.
*   **Updates**: Design documents should be reviewed and updated to reflect changes in the codebase and best practices.

See `spec-driven.md` in the root of the repository for the full philosophy.
