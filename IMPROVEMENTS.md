# Future Improvements

This document tracks all planned improvements and known limitations for the Spec Kit project.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Never add TODO comments to prompt files or templates! They can confuse AI agents. Always add improvements here instead.

---

## 🔴 High Priority

### Scripts (create-new-feature.sh / .ps1)

- [ ] Add automated tests for regex patterns and edge cases
- [ ] Add environment variable for enforcing Jira requirement (`REQUIRE_JIRA=true`)
- [ ] Improve error messages with examples and suggestions
- [ ] Add validation examples to help text

### Interactive Prompts

- [ ] Add validation of interactive input format with clear error messages
  - Constitution: Validate PRINCIPLES/PROJECT METADATA structure
  - Specify: Validate JIRA:/FEATURE: line format
- [ ] Add retry logic if user input is malformed
- [ ] Add feature description quality checks (minimum length, keyword detection)
- [ ] Add confirmation step showing what will be created before proceeding

---

## 🟡 Medium Priority

### Testing & Quality

- [ ] Create test suite for branch detection regex patterns
- [ ] Add integration tests for script execution with various inputs
- [ ] Add smoke tests for common scenarios
- [ ] Test edge cases:
  - Very long branch names (near 244 char limit)
  - Special characters in Jira numbers
  - Empty/whitespace inputs
  - Concurrent branch creation

### Documentation

- [ ] Replace `[PLACEHOLDER_CONSTITUTION_EXAMPLES_LINK]` with real URL
- [ ] Add inline constitution examples (remove external dependency)
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common errors
- [ ] Document branch naming convention in README

### User Experience

- [ ] Add progress indicators for long-running operations
- [ ] Improve error messages with actionable suggestions
- [ ] Add `--dry-run` flag to preview branch creation
- [ ] Add `--force` flag to override validations when needed

---

## 🟢 Low Priority / Nice to Have

### AGENTS.md Enforcement

- [ ] Explore technical enforcement alternatives (currently guidance-only)
- [ ] Add verification token system (if feasible)
- [ ] IDE plugin to auto-inject AGENTS.md into context
- [ ] Add reminder if AGENTS.md exists but not acknowledged

### Interactive Mode Enhancements

- [ ] Add autocomplete for common patterns
- [ ] Add interactive help/examples on demand
- [ ] Support multiple input formats (JSON, YAML, key-value)
- [ ] Add template library for common project types

### Branch Management

- [ ] Add command to list all feature branches
- [ ] Add command to cleanup old/merged branches
- [ ] Add branch naming validation before creation

### Corporate Guidelines - Phase 2 (Configurable Branch Naming)

- [ ] Create `branch-config.json` schema and examples
- [ ] Add JSON schema validation for branch configuration
- [ ] Refactor `create-new-feature.sh` to read from config file
- [ ] Refactor `create-new-feature.ps1` to read from config file
- [ ] Update documentation for branch configuration
- [ ] Add examples for common branch naming patterns
- [ ] Test with multiple branch naming patterns

### Corporate Guidelines - Phase 3 (Multi-Stack Coordination)

- [ ] Implement guideline precedence rules for multi-stack projects
- [ ] Add guideline version management (optional)
- [ ] Create guideline validation tool
- [ ] Add guideline update notifications
- [ ] Support team-specific guideline overrides

### Corporate Guidelines - Phase 4 (Advanced Features)

- [ ] Interactive guideline compliance checker
- [ ] Guideline diff tool (compare project vs template)
- [ ] Auto-fix common guideline violations
- [ ] Guideline analytics (compliance metrics)
- [ ] CI/CD integration for guideline checking

### PowerShell Script

- [ ] Improve regex matching (mirror bash improvements)
- [ ] Add better error handling for Windows-specific issues
- [ ] Test on PowerShell Core (cross-platform)

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### By Design

- **Jira number is optional:** Can be made required via env var (future)
- **AGENTS.md enforcement is guidance-only:** Technical enforcement not feasible with current architecture
- **Interactive mode detection fragile:** Relies on literal `$ARGUMENTS` string matching
- **Branch numbering race condition:** Possible if multiple users create branches simultaneously

### Technical Constraints

- **No real-time validation:** Can't validate input until agent processes it
- **IDE-dependent behavior:** Some IDEs may not support interactive prompts well
- **Git fetch required:** Branch detection needs network access to check remote branches

## 📝 Maintenance

### Review Schedule

- **Monthly:** Review this document and prioritize items
- **Per sprint:** Pick 1-2 high priority items to implement
- **As needed:** Add new items as they're discovered

### Adding New Items

When adding improvements:

1. Choose priority level (🔴 High / 🟡 Medium / 🟢 Low)
2. Add checkbox with clear description
3. Include why it's needed and impact if not done
4. Link to related issues/PRs if applicable

### Completing Items

When completing improvements:

1. Mark checkbox as complete: `- [x]`
2. Add completion date and PR link
3. Move to "Completed" section at bottom (optional)
4. Update related documentation
