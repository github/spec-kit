## Session Naming Convention

Session IDs follow the format: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-[topic-slug]`

- `YYYYMMDD`: Date the session started
- `HHMMSS`: Time the session started (24-hour format)
- `[topic-slug]`: URL-friendly version of the topic (lowercase, hyphens)

## Files in Each Session

### `metadata.json`
Contains session metadata:
```json
{
  "session_id": "20251104-103042-code-review-improvement",
  "topic": "How can we improve our code review process?",
  "mode": "standard",
  "status": "completed",
  "started_at": "2025-11-04T10:30:42Z",
  "completed_at": "2025-11-04T11:15:20Z",
  "rounds_completed": 3,
  "roles": ["Developer", "Product Manager", "End User Advocate"],
  "can_resume": false
}
```

### `round-0-inspiration.md`
Cross-domain inspiration and analogies identified before ideation.

### `round-1-ideas.md`
Initial ideas generated by each expert role independently.

### `round-2-debate.md`
Challenge-rebuttal phase and hybrid idea formation.

### `round-3-synthesis.md`
Multi-agent evaluation matrix, consensus recommendations, and user impact analysis.

### `final-report.md`
Comprehensive brainstorming report with top recommendations and next steps.

## Quick Access Reports

The `reports/` directory contains symbolic links to final reports for easy access:

- Named with date and topic slug: `YYYY-MM-DD-[topic-slug].md`
- Points to the actual final report in the session directory
- Easier to browse and find recent sessions

## Resuming Sessions

To resume an interrupted session:

```bash
/specify.innovate --resume 20251104-103042-code-review-improvement
```

The command will:
1. Load the metadata to check session status
2. Load completed rounds from the session directory
3. Continue from where it left off
4. Save the completed session back to the same directory

## Session Status

Sessions can have the following statuses:

- `in_progress`: Session was interrupted before completion
- `completed`: Session finished all planned rounds
- `cancelled`: Session was explicitly cancelled by user

Only sessions with `status: "in_progress"` and `can_resume: true` can be resumed.

## Viewing Past Sessions

To view a past session report:

1. Navigate to `.specify/brainstorms/reports/`
2. Find the report by date and topic
3. Open the markdown file in your editor or viewer

Or directly open a session's final report:

```bash
cat .specify/brainstorms/sessions/[session-id]/final-report.md
```

## Cleaning Up Old Sessions

To remove old brainstorming sessions:

1. Delete the session directory: `rm -rf .specify/brainstorms/sessions/[session-id]/`
2. Remove the corresponding report symlink: `rm .specify/brainstorms/reports/[report-name].md`

Or to remove all sessions:

```bash
rm -rf .specify/brainstorms/
```

## Notes

- Sessions are automatically saved after each round for crash recovery
- All session data is stored locally in your project
- Session files are plain Markdown and JSON for easy viewing and version control
- The `.specify/brainstorms/` directory is typically added to `.gitignore` to avoid committing brainstorm sessions
