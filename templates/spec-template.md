# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs
   - **Odoo-specific**: Module dependencies, access groups, record rules, view requirements, field types and relationships

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "validate email addresses"]  
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "reset their password"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Odoo Addon Architecture *(mandatory for Odoo projects)*

### Addon Strategy Assessment
**Constitutional analysis of user requirements**
- **Strategy Chosen**: [Single Addon / Multi-Addon]
- **Rationale**: [Why this strategy was chosen based on constitutional indicators]
- **Assessment Factors**: [Customer flexibility needs, localization, technology choices, business domains affected]

### Addon Decomposition Strategy
**Feature breakdown into coherent groups** *(complete this section based on chosen strategy)*

#### If Single Addon Strategy:
- **[Addon Name]**: [Comprehensive description of coherent feature group, e.g., "advanced_inventory_analytics - Complete inventory analytics with reporting, dashboards, and alerts"]

#### If Multi-Addon Strategy:
- **[Core Addon Name]** (Core): [Primary coherent feature group, e.g., "project_analytics_base - Core analytics models, basic reporting, and essential dashboards"]
- **[Extension Addon Name]** (Optional): [Enhanced feature group, e.g., "project_analytics_advanced - AI insights, predictive analytics, and advanced visualizations"]
- **[Integration Addon Name]** (Integration): [Technology-specific group, e.g., "project_analytics_slack - Slack integration, notifications, and collaborative reporting"]
- **[Localization Addon Name]** (Localization): [Region-specific group, e.g., "project_analytics_fr - French localization, compliance reporting, and local integrations"]

### Addon Dependencies & Relationships
**Dependencies based on chosen strategy**

#### If Single Addon Strategy:
```
[Addon Name]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Core Dependencies: [required Odoo modules, e.g., base, sale, stock]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Optional Dependencies: [optional Odoo modules that enhance functionality]
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ External Dependencies: [third-party modules or APIs if any]
```

#### If Multi-Addon Strategy:
```
[Core Addon]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Core Dependencies: [base, project, sale]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Inter-addon Dependencies: [none - this is the base]
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Optional Dependencies: [hr, timesheet]

[Extension Addon]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Core Dependencies: [base, project]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Inter-addon Dependencies: [core_addon_name]
