# Project Constitution

## Core Principles

1. **User First**: All decisions should be evaluated based on their impact on the user experience.
2. **Simplicity**: Prefer simple, understandable solutions over complex, clever ones.
3. **Consistency**: Follow established patterns and standards across the codebase.
4. **Quality**: Automated testing is not optional; code without tests is incomplete.
5. **Documentation**: Code tells you how; comments and docs tell you why.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: [React / Vue / Angular]
- **Backend**: [Node.js / Python / Go / Java]
- **Database**: [PostgreSQL / MongoDB / Redis]
- **Infrastructure**: [AWS / GCP / Azure] via [Terraform / Pulumi]

## Governance

- **Decision Making**: Use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for significant technical choices.
- **RFC Process**: Major changes require a Request for Comments (RFC) document before implementation.
- **Code Ownership**: defined in `CODEOWNERS` file.
