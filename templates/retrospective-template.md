## Retrospective Format

This retrospective follows a structured format similar to `/speckit.clarify` but focused on understanding past decisions and identifying improvements. The goal is to:

1. **Clarify unclear decisions** - Understand why choices were made
2. **Identify patterns** - What worked well and what didn't
3. **Generate actionable improvements** - Concrete changes for next sprint
4. **Preserve knowledge** - Document context for future reference
