## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Pre-Execution Checks

**Model configuration gate (MANDATORY — before anything else)**:
- Check for a model configuration file, in this order:
  1. `.specify/models.json` in the project root
  2. `~/.specify/models.json` (user-level fallback)
- If NEITHER file exists, **STOP immediately**. Do not proceed with any other step. Output:

  ```
  ## Model Configuration Required

  No models.json found (.specify/models.json or ~/.specify/models.json).
  Spec Kit needs to know which models are available to this agent before running.

  Run `__SPECKIT_COMMAND_MODELS__` first, then re-run this command.
  ```

- If a file exists, read it (project file wins) and keep it in context for this command:
  - `manager` is the communicator/orchestrator: it classifies each task/step's level (1-5) and delegates; it never implements tasks.
  - `by_complexity` maps task complexity levels (`5` = critical, `4` = complex, `3` = moderate/workhorse, `2` = simple, `1` = trivial, plus optional specialized keys) to the models that should execute such tasks.
  - Level `5` models are reserved for very few cases (manager role, exceptional tasks) — never assign them to routine work.
- If the file exists but cannot be parsed as JSON, or is missing `manager` or `by_complexity`, STOP and tell the user to re-run `__SPECKIT_COMMAND_MODELS__` to regenerate it.

**Orchestrator dispatch (MANDATORY — applies to every step below)**:
- You are the `manager` (communicator). You do **not** write the issue bodies yourself. For each substantive step of this command, classify its complexity level (`5` critical → `1` trivial), look up that level in `by_complexity`, and dispatch the step to the first candidate through its `executors` entry.
- Typical levels here: composing issue bodies and dependency ordering → `2`; mechanical conversion and formatting → `1`. Keep the actual GitHub write calls in the manager so credentials and side effects stay in one place.
- Dispatch is optimistic: if the invocation fails (agent not loaded, unknown agent name, model unavailable), fall through to the next candidate in that level's list. If every candidate fails, report the attempts and only then continue in-session.
- Keep in the manager only: reading configuration, classifying steps, asking the user questions, issue creation calls, merging worker output, and the final report.
- Give each worker only the context it needs (paths, prior artifacts, the exact step definition) and require it to return the produced content.

**Check for extension hooks (before tasks-to-issues conversion)**:
- Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.before_taskstoissues` key
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue normally
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}

    Wait for the result of the hook command before proceeding to the Outline.
    ```
    After emitting the block above you MUST actually invoke the hook and wait for it to finish before continuing. Run it the same way you would run the command yourself in this agent/session (the invocation may differ from the literal `{command}` id shown above, e.g. a skills-mode agent runs it as `/skill:speckit-...` or `$speckit-...`). Emitting the block alone does not run the hook.
- If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently

## Outline

1. Run `{SCRIPT}` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").
1. **IF EXISTS**: Load `/memory/constitution.md` for project principles and governance constraints.
1. From the executed script, extract the path to **tasks**.
1. Get the Git remote by running:

```bash
git config --get remote.origin.url
```

> [!CAUTION]
> ONLY PROCEED TO NEXT STEPS IF THE REMOTE IS A GITHUB URL

1. **Fetch existing issues for deduplication**: Before creating anything, build the set of task IDs you are about to process from `tasks.md` (each is a `T` followed by three digits, e.g. `T001`). Then use the GitHub MCP server's `list_issues` tool to look for issues that already cover those IDs. Do not pass a `state` value, since omitting it makes the tool return both open and closed issues. Request `perPage: 100` to keep the number of calls down, and since the tool uses cursor-based pagination, request pages with the `after` parameter (using the `endCursor` from the previous response). For each issue title, match it against the task ID pattern `\bT\d{3}\b` (word boundaries so tokens like `ST001` or `T0010` are not matched by mistake; this also recognises titles written as `T001 ...`, `T001: ...` or `[T001] ...`) and, when it matches one of your task IDs, mark that ID as already having an issue. Stop paginating as soon as every task ID has been matched, or when there are no more pages, so you do not keep fetching the whole repository's issue history once all task IDs are accounted for. This bounds the number of calls on repos with large issue histories and still prevents duplicates when the command is re-run after `tasks.md` is regenerated or the skill is re-invoked.
1. For each task in the list, use the GitHub MCP server to create a new issue in the repository that is representative of the Git remote. Task lines in `tasks.md` start with a markdown checkbox, so first strip the leading `- [ ]` (and any `[P]` / `[US#]` markers) to recover the task ID and its description. Create the issue with a single canonical title of the form `T001: <description>`, with the ID written once followed by the task description (for example, the line `- [ ] T001 Create project structure` becomes the title `T001: Create project structure`).
   - **Skip** any task whose ID is already present in the set of existing issues from the previous step, and report it (for example, `T001 already has an issue, skipping`).
   - Only create issues for tasks that do not yet have a matching issue.

> [!CAUTION]
> UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES EVER CREATE ISSUES IN REPOSITORIES THAT DO NOT MATCH THE REMOTE URL

## Post-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (after tasks-to-issues conversion)**:
Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.after_taskstoissues` key
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue normally
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
    ```
    After emitting the block above you MUST actually invoke the hook and wait for it to finish before continuing. Run it the same way you would run the command yourself in this agent/session (the invocation may differ from the literal `{command}` id shown above, e.g. a skills-mode agent runs it as `/skill:speckit-...` or `$speckit-...`). Emitting the block alone does not run the hook.
- If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently
