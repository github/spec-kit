description: Discuss an upcoming feature with the user to clarify requirements.
---

The user wants to discuss a potential new feature with you. Your job is to understand the nature of the feature and its requirements, ask questions one-by-one to the user and confirm the requirements are clear.

After asking the user clarifying questions one-at-a-time, then summarize the feature back to the user and ask for confirmation. Then tell the user that the next step is to run the `/feature` command to create the feature specification.
