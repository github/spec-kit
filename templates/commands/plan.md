The user input to you can be provided directly by the agent or as a command argument - you **MUST** consider it before proceeding with the prompt (if not empty).

User input:

$ARGUMENTS

Given the implementation details provided as an argument, do this:

1. Run `{SCRIPT}` from the repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_SPEC, IMPL_PLAN, SPECS_DIR, BRANCH. All future file paths must be absolute.
   - BEFORE proceeding, inspect FEATURE_SPEC for a `## Clarifications` section with at least one `Session` subheading. If missing or clearly ambiguous areas remain (vague adjectives, unresolved critical choices), PAUSE and instruct the user to run `/clarify` first to reduce rework. Only continue if: (a) Clarifications exist OR (b) an explicit user override is provided (e.g., "proceed without clarification"). Do not attempt to fabricate clarifications yourself.
2. Read and analyze the feature specification to understand:
   - The feature requirements and user stories
   - Functional and non-functional requirements
   - Success criteria and acceptance criteria
   - Any technical constraints or dependencies mentioned

3. Read the constitution at `/memory/constitution.md` to understand constitutional requirements.

4. Execute the implementation plan template:
   - Load `/templates/plan-template.md` (already copied to IMPL_PLAN path)
   - Set Input path to FEATURE_SPEC
   - Run the Execution Flow (main) function steps 1-9
   - The template is self-contained and executable
   - Follow error handling and gate checks as specified
   - Let the template guide artifact generation in $SPECS_DIR:
     * Phase 0 generates research.md
     * Phase 1 generates data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md
     * Phase 2 generates tasks.md
   - Incorporate user-provided details from arguments into Technical Context: {ARGS}
   - Update Progress Tracking as you complete each phase

5. Verify execution completed:
   - Check Progress Tracking shows all phases complete
   - Ensure all required artifacts were generated
   - Confirm no ERROR states in execution

6. Commit and push the changes:
   - Stage all generated artifacts and modified files
   - Create a commit with a descriptive message summarizing the plan
   - Push the branch (BRANCH) to remote

7. Create or update a Pull Request:
   - **Target branch**: The PR must be against the default branch
   - **PR status**: The PR must be opened as a draft
   - **Determine PR type and icon** based on the changes:

     | Type of change | Icon | Label |
     |-|-|-|
     | Docs | üìñ | Docs |
     | Fix | ü™≤ | Fix, Patch |
     | Security fix | ‚ö†Ô∏è | Fix |
     | Patch | ü©π | Patch |
     | Feature | üöÄ | Minor |
     | Breaking change | üåü | Major |

   - **PR title format**: `<Icon> [Type of change]: <Short description>`
   - **PR description structure**:
     * Start with a summary paragraph describing the key outcome and changes for user
     * DO NOT add a title before the leading paragraph
     * At the end of the PR paragraph, add a "- Fixes #<issue-number>" line to link the PR to the issue
     * Follow with additional details answering Why, How, and What
     * Avoid superfluous headers or sections
     * We do not need details, we need to add what changes for the user of the code
   - **Apply appropriate label(s)** based on the type of change
   - **Link the PR** to the associated issue

   **GitHub Integration**: If GitHub tools or integrations are available (such as through MCP), use them to create/update the PR and manage labels automatically. If not available, provide these fallback commands:
   ```bash
   # Create draft PR
   gh pr create --draft --title "<Icon> [Type]: <Description>" --body "<PR description>" --label "<Type>"

   # Link to issue (if not using "Fixes #<issue>" in body)
   gh pr edit <PR-number> --add-label "<Type>"
   ```

8. Update issue labels:
   - Remove `Specification` label from the linked issue
   - Add `Plan` label to the linked issue

   **GitHub Integration**: If GitHub tools are available, update labels automatically. If not available, use:
   ```bash
   gh issue edit <issue-number> --remove-label "Specification" --add-label "Plan"
   ```

9. Report results with branch name, PR URL, file paths, and generated artifacts.

Use absolute paths with the repository root for all file operations to avoid path issues.
