## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Pre-Execution Checks

**Model configuration gate (MANDATORY — before anything else)**:
- Check for a model configuration file, in this order:
  1. `.specify/models.json` in the project root
  2. `~/.specify/models.json` (user-level fallback)
- If NEITHER file exists, **STOP immediately**. Do not proceed with any other step. Output:

  ```
  ## Model Configuration Required

  No models.json found (.specify/models.json or ~/.specify/models.json).
  Spec Kit needs to know which models are available to this agent before running.

  Run `__SPECKIT_COMMAND_MODELS__` first, then re-run this command.
  ```

- If a file exists, read it (project file wins) and keep it in context for this command:
  - `manager` is the communicator/orchestrator: it classifies each task/step's level (1-5) and delegates; it never implements tasks.
  - `by_complexity` maps task complexity levels (`5` = critical, `4` = complex, `3` = moderate/workhorse, `2` = simple, `1` = trivial, plus optional specialized keys) to the models that should execute such tasks.
  - Level `5` models are reserved for very few cases (manager role, exceptional tasks) — never assign them to routine work.
- If the file exists but cannot be parsed as JSON, or is missing `manager` or `by_complexity`, STOP and tell the user to re-run `__SPECKIT_COMMAND_MODELS__` to regenerate it.

**Check for extension hooks (before implementation)**:
- Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.before_implement` key
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue normally
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}

    Wait for the result of the hook command before proceeding to the Outline.
    ```
    After emitting the block above you MUST actually invoke the hook and wait for it to finish before continuing. Run it the same way you would run the command yourself in this agent/session (the invocation may differ from the literal `{command}` id shown above, e.g. a skills-mode agent runs it as `/skill:speckit-...` or `$speckit-...`). Emitting the block alone does not run the hook.
- If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently

## Outline

1. Run `{SCRIPT}` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Check checklists status** (if FEATURE_DIR/checklists/ exists):
   - Scan all checklist files in the checklists/ directory
   - For each checklist, count:
     - Total items: All lines matching `- [ ]` or `- [X]` or `- [x]`
     - Completed items: Lines matching `- [X]` or `- [x]`
     - Incomplete items: Lines matching `- [ ]`
   - Create a status table:

     ```text
     | Checklist | Total | Completed | Incomplete | Status |
     |-----------|-------|-----------|------------|--------|
     | ux.md     | 12    | 12        | 0          | ✓ PASS |
     | test.md   | 8     | 5         | 3          | ✗ FAIL |
     | security.md | 6   | 6         | 0          | ✓ PASS |
     ```

   - Calculate overall status:
     - **PASS**: All checklists have 0 incomplete items
     - **FAIL**: One or more checklists have incomplete items

   - **If any checklist is incomplete**:
     - Display the table with incomplete item counts
     - **STOP** and ask: "Some checklists are incomplete. Do you want to proceed with implementation anyway? (yes/no)"
     - Wait for user response before continuing
     - If user says "no" or "wait" or "stop", halt execution
     - If user says "yes" or "proceed" or "continue", proceed to step 3

   - **If all checklists are complete**:
     - Display the table showing all checklists passed
     - Automatically proceed to step 3

3. Load and analyze the implementation context:
   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan
   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read /memory/constitution.md for governance constraints
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios

4. **Project Setup Verification**:
   - **REQUIRED**: Create/verify ignore files based on actual project setup:

   **Detection & Creation Logic**:
   - Check if the following command succeeds to determine if the repository is a git repo (create/verify .gitignore if so):

     ```sh
     git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null
     ```

   - Check if Dockerfile* exists or Docker in plan.md → create/verify .dockerignore
   - Check if .eslintrc* exists → create/verify .eslintignore
   - Check if eslint.config.* exists → ensure the config's `ignores` entries cover required patterns
   - Check if .prettierrc* exists → create/verify .prettierignore
   - Check if .npmrc or package.json exists → create/verify .npmignore (if publishing)
   - Check if terraform files (*.tf) exist → create/verify .terraformignore
   - Check if .helmignore needed (helm charts present) → create/verify .helmignore

   **If ignore file already exists**: Verify it contains essential patterns, append missing critical patterns only
   **If ignore file missing**: Create with full pattern set for detected technology

5. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:
   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish
   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules
   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]
   - **Complexity/model labels**: `[C:n<level>->model]` markers assigning each task a complexity level (1-5) and an executor model from `models.json`
   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements

6. Execute implementation following the task plan:
   - **Read models.json and resolve candidates**: Load `.specify/models.json` (or `~/.specify/models.json`). Extract:
     - `manager` id (the communicator; never executes tasks)
     - `by_complexity` ordered model lists for each level (`1`-`5`)
     - `executors` map describing how each model can actually be selected
   - **Model-aware dispatch (per task)**: Each task carries a `[C:n<level>->model]` label. The right-hand side of the label is the preferred model recorded when tasks were generated; if it is not the first available candidate for that level, use the current ordered list from `models.json` as the source of truth. Resolve the executor as follows:
     - Look up the task's level in `by_complexity`. The ordered list is the source of truth.
     - Start with the first model. The remaining models are ordered fallbacks, not load-balancing targets.
   - **Executor dispatch**: Resolve the candidate in `executors`:
     - `native_subagent`: invoke the exact named agent directly. There is no verification gate — if the invocation fails (agent not loaded yet, unknown agent name, model unavailable), treat it as an availability failure and fall through to the next candidate.
     - `current_session`: execute in this conversation only when the recorded model matches the current runtime model.
     - `manual`: pause and provide the recorded model-switch/continuation instructions; never claim automatic dispatch.
     - Never launch an agent CLI or a second process of the current host to execute a task. Every automatic worker must be native to the agent/CLI hosting this conversation.
   - **Availability fallback**: If the selected model fails because the agent could not be invoked, usage/token exhaustion, rate limiting, model unavailability, provider outage, or context limits, preserve verified progress and retry with the next candidate in the list. Include the original task, changed files, test results, completed work, and remaining work so the fallback continues safely. Never retry a failed candidate in a loop. If the next executor is manual, pause with exact instructions. If all candidates fail, stop and report every attempt. Do not switch models merely to mask an ordinary code or test failure.
   - **Tasks missing a `[C:...]` label** default to level `3` (moderate, the workhorse).
   - **The `manager` model normally never executes tasks** — it orchestrates. It may also appear in a candidate list only when the discovered catalog is too small to reserve it or the user explicitly assigns it.
   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next
   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order; tasks marked [P] can run together
   - **Parallel execution (MANDATORY when supported)**: If the agent can run subagents/tasks concurrently, you MUST parallelize [P] tasks instead of running them one by one:
     - Within the current phase, group ready [P] tasks (dependencies met) into a batch. Exclude from the same batch any two tasks that touch the same file.
     - Dispatch the whole batch concurrently when the selected candidates have executors that support independent execution (`native_subagent`). Each worker starts with the first candidate from its `by_complexity` list and receives only the context it needs; any worker whose invocation fails falls through to its next candidate.
     - Wait for the entire batch to finish before dispatching tasks that depend on it. Then form the next batch.
     - Sequential tasks (no [P]) always run one at a time in order.
     - If the agent has NO concurrency support, run [P] tasks sequentially and note it in the completion report.
   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks
   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially — never in the same parallel batch
   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding

7. Implementation execution rules:
   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration
   - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios
   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints
   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services
   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation

8. Progress tracking and error handling:
   - Report progress after each completed task
   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails
   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones
   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging
   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed
   - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.

9. Completion validation:
   - Verify all required tasks are completed
   - Check that implemented features match the original specification
   - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements
   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan

Note: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `__SPECKIT_COMMAND_TASKS__` first to regenerate the task list.

## Mandatory Post-Execution Hooks

**You MUST complete this section before reporting completion to the user.**

Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it does not exist, or no hooks are registered under `hooks.after_implement`, skip to the Completion Report.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.after_implement` key.
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue to the Completion Report.
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`) — **You MUST emit `EXECUTE_COMMAND:` for each mandatory hook**:
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
    ```
    After emitting the block above you MUST actually invoke the hook and wait for it to finish before continuing. Run it the same way you would run the command yourself in this agent/session (the invocation may differ from the literal `{command}` id shown above, e.g. a skills-mode agent runs it as `/skill:speckit-...` or `$speckit-...`). Emitting the block alone does not run the hook.
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
