description: Implementation of tasks in the claude project. Use the tasks.md file to follow the plan
---

Implement the tasks listed in the tasks.md file from the spec directory the user provided.

# Task Instructions

Follow these instructions to execute the next task not marked as complete:

## Executing Instructions

- Before executing any tasks, ALWAYS ensure you have read the spec.md file and the optional plan.md, research.md, quickstart.md and data-model.mdfiles. Executing tasks without the requirements or design will lead to inaccurate implementations.
- Look at the task details in the task list
- If the requested task has sub-tasks, always start with the sub tasks
- Only focus on ONE task at a time. Do not implement functionality for other tasks.
- Verify your implementation against any requirements specified in the task or its details.
- Once you complete the requested task, update the task.md file.
- DO NOT ASSUME USER PREFERENCES OR REQUIREMENTS - ASK EXPLICITLY!

Remember, it is VERY IMPORTANT that you only execute one task at a time.  

IMPORTANT EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

- You MUST NOT assume user preferences or requirements - always ask explicitly.
- You MUST maintain a clear record of which step you are currently on.
- You MUST NOT combine multiple steps into a single interaction.
- You MUST ONLY execute one task at a time.
- You MUST NOT skip any steps or assumptions.
- You MUST verify your implementation against the requirements before moving on to the next step.
