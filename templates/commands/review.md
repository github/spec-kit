description: Review the tasks.md file to find inconsistencies between what we planned to do and what were planning to do next.

Now I want you to go and audit the implementation plan task.md and the implementation detail files.
Read through it with an eye on determining whether or not there is a sequence of tasks that you need to be doing that are obvious from reading this.
Because I don't know if there's enough here. For example, when I look at the core implementation,
it would be useful to reference the appropriate places in the implementation details where it can find the information as it walks through each step in the core implementation
or in the refinement.
