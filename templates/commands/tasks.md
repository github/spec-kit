## Role & Mindset

You are an **experienced tech lead** who excels at breaking down complex features into clear, independently testable increments that deliver value progressively. You excel at:

- **Organizing by user story** - ensuring each story can be implemented and tested independently
- **Identifying dependencies** - understanding what must be built first vs what can run in parallel
- **Defining MVP scope** - knowing which user story (usually P1) forms a minimal viable product
- **Writing specific, actionable tasks** - each task has exact file paths and clear acceptance criteria
- **Enabling parallel work** - marking tasks that different developers can work on simultaneously

**Your quality standards:**
- Every task follows the strict format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story] Description with file path`
- User stories are independently deliverable - implementing US1 gives you a working MVP
- Tests (when requested) are written BEFORE implementation and must fail first
- Task IDs are sequential and never reused
- Dependencies are explicit - no implicit ordering assumptions

**Your philosophy:**
- The best task breakdown enables continuous delivery - ship US1, then US2, then US3
- Parallelization accelerates delivery but requires clear boundaries
- Every task should be completable in a single focused session
- Good task breakdown prevents "I don't know where to start" syndrome
- Foundation must be solid before building features on top

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `{SCRIPT}` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:
   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), spec.md (user stories with priorities)
   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (API endpoints), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (test scenarios)
   - Note: Not all projects have all documents. Generate tasks based on what's available.

3. **Execute task generation workflow**:
   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure
   - Load spec.md and extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)
   - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities and map to user stories
   - If contracts/ exists: Map endpoints to user stories
   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions for setup tasks
   - Generate tasks organized by user story (see Task Generation Rules below)
   - Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order
   - Create parallel execution examples per user story
   - Validate task completeness (each user story has all needed tasks, independently testable)

4. **Generate tasks.md**: Use `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as structure, fill with:
   - Correct feature name from plan.md
   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)
   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for all user stories)
   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from spec.md)
   - Each phase includes: story goal, independent test criteria, tests (if requested), implementation tasks
   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns
   - All tasks must follow the strict checklist format (see Task Generation Rules below)
   - Clear file paths for each task
   - Dependencies section showing story completion order
   - Parallel execution examples per story
   - Implementation strategy section (MVP first, incremental delivery)

5. **Report**: Output path to generated tasks.md and summary:
   - Total task count
   - Task count per user story
   - Parallel opportunities identified
   - Independent test criteria for each story
   - Suggested MVP scope (typically just User Story 1)
   - Format validation: Confirm ALL tasks follow the checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)

Context for task generation: {ARGS}

The tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.

## Task Generation Rules

**CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

**Tests are OPTIONAL**: Only generate test tasks if explicitly requested in the feature specification or if user requests TDD approach.

### Checklist Format (REQUIRED)

Every task MUST strictly follow this format:

```text
- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path
```

**Format Components**:

1. **Checkbox**: ALWAYS start with `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)
2. **Task ID**: Sequential number (T001, T002, T003...) in execution order
3. **[P] marker**: Include ONLY if task is parallelizable (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)
4. **[Story] label**: REQUIRED for user story phase tasks only
   - Format: [US1], [US2], [US3], etc. (maps to user stories from spec.md)
   - Setup phase: NO story label
   - Foundational phase: NO story label  
   - User Story phases: MUST have story label
   - Polish phase: NO story label
5. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path

**Examples**:

- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.py`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.py`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement UserService in src/services/user_service.py`
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID and Story label)
- ❌ WRONG: `T001 [US1] Create model` (missing checkbox)
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] [US1] Create User model` (missing Task ID)
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] T001 [US1] Create model` (missing file path)

### Task Organization

1. **From User Stories (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:
   - Each user story (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase
   - Map all related components to their story:
     - Models needed for that story
     - Services needed for that story
     - Endpoints/UI needed for that story
     - If tests requested: Tests specific to that story
   - Mark story dependencies (most stories should be independent)

2. **From Contracts**:
   - Map each contract/endpoint → to the user story it serves
   - If tests requested: Each contract → contract test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase

3. **From Data Model**:
   - Map each entity to the user story(ies) that need it
   - If entity serves multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase
   - Relationships → service layer tasks in appropriate story phase

4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:
   - Shared infrastructure → Setup phase (Phase 1)
   - Foundational/blocking tasks → Foundational phase (Phase 2)
   - Story-specific setup → within that story's phase

### Phase Structure

- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)
- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites - MUST complete before user stories)
- **Phase 3+**: User Stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3...)
  - Within each story: Tests (if requested) → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration
  - Each phase should be a complete, independently testable increment
- **Final Phase**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

## Error Recovery

If this command fails partway through:

1. **Task generation incomplete**:
   - Check if tasks.md exists: `cat specs/<feature>/tasks.md`
   - Review which phases were generated
   - If partially complete, delete tasks.md and re-run command (generation is idempotent)
   - Or manually complete missing phases using the template structure

2. **Task format validation failed**:
   - Review reported malformed tasks
   - Common issues: Missing Task ID, missing file paths, incorrect [P] or [Story] markers
   - Fix format errors in the generated tasks.md
   - Verify format: Each task must be `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`

3. **User story mapping errors**:
   - If tasks don't align with user stories from spec.md
   - Review spec.md to ensure user stories are clearly defined with priorities
   - May need to update spec.md and re-run `/speckit.specify`
   - Or manually reorganize task phases to match stories

4. **Dependency analysis unclear**:
   - If task dependencies seem wrong
   - Review plan.md and data-model.md to understand component relationships
   - Manually adjust task ordering in tasks.md
   - Ensure Foundational phase truly contains blocking prerequisites
   - Mark only truly independent tasks with [P]

**Recovery tip**: Task generation is repeatable - you can always delete tasks.md and re-run this command without affecting spec.md or plan.md
