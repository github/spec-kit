# Issue Specification: [ISSUE NAME]

**Issue Number**: `[001-dashboard-loading]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Issue description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse issue description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No issue description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: problem, impact, affected systems, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill Problem Statement & Impact section
   ‚Üí If no clear problem: ERROR "Cannot determine issue scope"
5. Generate Issue Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Affected Systems (if applicable)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Issue has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If solution details found: ERROR "Remove solution details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (issue ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT is broken and WHY it matters
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to fix (no implementation details, code changes, tech stack)
- üë• Written for stakeholders and developers to understand the problem

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every issue
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the issue
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this issue from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login broken" without error details), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - Error conditions and symptoms
   - User impact and severity
   - Affected user types or systems
   - Reproduction steps
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Performance impact
   - Security implications

## Problem Statement & Impact *(mandatory)*

### Issue Summary
[Describe the problem in plain language - what is broken or not working as expected]

### Current Behavior
[Describe what is currently happening - the actual behavior]

### Expected Behavior
[Describe what should be happening - the desired behavior]

### Impact Assessment
- **User Impact**: [How does this affect users?]
- **Business Impact**: [How does this affect business operations?]
- **System Impact**: [How does this affect system performance/reliability?]

### Reproduction Steps
1. [Step 1 to reproduce the issue]
2. [Step 2 to reproduce the issue]
3. [Step 3 to reproduce the issue]
4. **Result**: [What actually happens]
5. **Expected**: [What should happen]

## Issue Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **IR-001**: System MUST [specific behavior that should work, e.g., "allow users to login successfully"]
- **IR-002**: System MUST [specific behavior, e.g., "display error messages clearly"]  
- **IR-003**: System MUST [specific behavior, e.g., "handle invalid input gracefully"]
- **IR-004**: System MUST [specific behavior, e.g., "maintain data consistency"]
- **IR-005**: System MUST [specific behavior, e.g., "log errors appropriately"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **IR-006**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific error condition not specified]
- **IR-007**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: user type or scenario not specified]

### Affected Systems *(include if issue affects multiple systems)*
- **[System 1]**: [What system is affected, how it's impacted]
- **[System 2]**: [What system is affected, relationships to other systems]

### Constraints & Dependencies
- **Technical Constraints**: [Any technical limitations that affect the solution]
- **Business Constraints**: [Any business rules or policies that must be considered]
- **Dependencies**: [Other issues, features, or systems that this issue depends on]
