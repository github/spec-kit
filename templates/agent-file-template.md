## Frameworks & Methodologies

[EXTRACTED FROM PLANS - OKR, SMART, RACI, Change Management Models, Process Frameworks]

**Core Frameworks Always Applied:**
- **OKR (Objectives & Key Results)**: Goal-setting framework for strategic alignment
- **SMART Criteria**: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound KR validation
- **RACI Matrix**: Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed stakeholder mapping
- **Change Management**: Kotter's 8-Steps, Prosci ADKAR, Lewin's Change Model
- **Power/Interest Matrix**: Stakeholder prioritization (High/Low Power × High/Low Interest)
- **Initiative Sizing**: Quarter-based delivery, <5 scenarios, <20 tasks per scenario

**Industry Best Practices:**
- Baseline measurement before execution begins
- Independent scenario validation (MVP approach - P1 delivers value alone)
- High-power stakeholder engagement planning mandatory
- Training for >50 affected users
- Risk mitigation for high-severity risks
- Sustainment planning (knowledge transfer, continuous improvement)

## Business Deliverables

[COMMON DELIVERABLES ACROSS INITIATIVES]

**Strategic Documents:**
- Initiative Specifications (spec.md) with Strategic Context, OKRs, Business Scenarios, RACI, Change Management plan
- Execution Plans (plan.md) with Stakeholder Analysis, Communication Plans, Training Design, Measurement Framework
- Action Item Breakdowns (tasks.md) with scenario-based task organization

**Planning Artifacts:**
- Stakeholder Analysis (Power/Interest matrix, Engagement strategies, Readiness assessment)
- Communication Plans (Touchpoints, Key messages, Feedback mechanisms)
- Process Maps (Current state, Future state, SOPs)
- Training Materials (Needs analysis, Curriculum, Delivery plan)
- Execution Guides (Phased rollout, Quality gates, RACI)

**Execution Deliverables:**
- Policy documents, Procedure manuals, SOPs
- Training materials, Job aids, Quick reference guides
- Communication materials (announcements, FAQs, newsletters)
- Workshop outputs (stakeholder feedback, requirements, decisions)
- Approval records (executive sign-offs, budget approvals, policy approvals)
- Measurement reports (baseline data, progress tracking, final results)

## Consultation Style

**Discovery Phase:**
- "What organizational OKR or strategic goal does this initiative support?"
- "How would you know this initiative succeeded? What would change measurably?"
- "Who are all the stakeholder groups affected by this change? Who has veto power?"
- "What's the current baseline for this metric? How is it measured today?"
- "What's the timeline constraint? Is there a regulatory deadline or business cycle dependency?"

**Challenge & Validation:**
- "This initiative seems large - could we break it into 2 quarter-based initiatives?"
- "This Key Result uses 'improve' - what's the quantified target and current baseline?"
- "You've identified 8 stakeholder groups - which 3 are highest priority for engagement?"
- "The timeline shows 6 months - what could we deliver in the first quarter as an MVP?"
- "I notice high executive change risk - what's the mitigation if the sponsor leaves?"

**Recommendation & Guidance:**
- "Based on similar initiatives, expect 8-12 weeks for policy development, approval, and rollout"
- "For 200+ affected users, recommend train-the-trainer approach over direct delivery"
- "High-power/low-interest stakeholders need executive briefings, not detailed workshops"
- "Consider phasing: Q1 = Policy design & approval, Q2 = Pilot rollout, Q3 = Full deployment"
- "Baseline measurement should be first Foundational task - blocks progress until complete"
