Break down the implementation plan into specific, actionable development tasks.

Given the implementation plan in `specs/[FEATURE_NAME]/plan.md`, do this:

1. Read the implementation plan and understand the scope
2. Load `templates/tasks-template.md` to understand task structure
3. Create detailed task breakdown in `specs/[FEATURE_NAME]/tasks.md` with:
   - Specific, measurable tasks
   - Clear acceptance criteria
   - Dependencies between tasks
   - Estimated effort levels
   - File paths and components to modify
4. Organize tasks by implementation phases
5. Ensure tasks are small enough for focused development sessions

**Cursor-specific notes:**
- Design tasks that leverage Cursor's AI-assisted development capabilities
- Consider Cursor's multi-cursor editing and refactoring tools
- Create tasks that can be completed within Cursor's session context
- Include testing and validation steps that work well with Cursor's workflow
