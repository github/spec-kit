## Core Principles

### 1. Code Quality
- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
- Follow established coding standards and patterns
- Prioritize readability and simplicity
- Maintain high test coverage

### 2. Collaboration
- Communicate clearly and proactively
- Review code thoughtfully and constructively
- Share knowledge and mentor team members
- Respect diverse perspectives and approaches

### 3. Continuous Improvement
- Refactor regularly to reduce technical debt
- Learn from mistakes and iterate
- Stay current with best practices
- Measure and optimize performance

### 4. User Focus
- Prioritize user needs and experience
- Design for accessibility and inclusivity
- Validate assumptions with data
- Deliver value incrementally

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- **Formatting:** Use automated formatters (e.g., Prettier, Black)
- **Linting:** Address all linter warnings
- **Comments:** Explain "why," not "what"
- **Naming:** Use clear, descriptive names

### Testing Standards
- Write tests before fixing bugs
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Include unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- Keep tests fast and focused

### Review Standards
- All code requires peer review
- Automated checks must pass before review
- Address feedback promptly and professionally
- Approve only when confident in changes

## Technical Decisions

### When to Refactor
- Code is difficult to understand or modify
- Patterns are duplicated across the codebase
- Performance issues are identified
- Technical debt is blocking new features

### When to Add Dependencies
- Solves a significant problem we can't easily solve ourselves
- Is actively maintained and well-documented
- Has acceptable license and security posture
- Team has evaluated alternatives

### When to Write Documentation
- Adding a new feature or module
- Changing existing behavior
- Setting up development environment
- Deploying to production

---

## Communication

### Code Reviews
- Be respectful and constructive
- Focus on the code, not the person
- Ask questions rather than make demands
- Acknowledge good work

### Specifications
- Write specifications before implementing features
- Keep specifications current as implementation evolves
- Use specifications to align understanding
- Review specifications with stakeholders

### Documentation
- Update documentation with code changes
- Write for your future self and others
- Include examples and diagrams
- Keep it concise and relevant

---

## Decision-Making

### Individual Decisions
- Coding style within guidelines
- Minor refactoring
- Test implementation details
- Variable and function naming

### Team Decisions
- Architecture changes
- New dependencies
- Breaking changes
- Process changes

### Leadership Decisions
- Technology stack changes
- Major architectural shifts
- Resource allocation
- Project priorities

## Project Values

1. **Quality over speed:** Do it right, not just fast
2. **Collaboration over hero culture:** Win as a team
3. **Simplicity over cleverness:** Clear beats complex
4. **Progress over perfection:** Ship and iterate
5. **Learning over ego:** Grow together
