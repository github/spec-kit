## What to Include

1. **Quality Standards** - What defines "done"
2. **Team Values** - How we work together
3. **Technical Principles** - Architectural guidelines
4. **Process** - How we build software
5. **Decision Framework** - Who decides what

## Example Principles

- **Quality over speed** - Do it right, not just fast
- **Collaboration over hero culture** - Win as a team
- **Simplicity over cleverness** - Clear beats complex
- **Progress over perfection** - Ship and iterate

## Best Practices

- Get explicit agreement
- Revisit periodically
- Update as team evolves
- Reference in code reviews
- Use in onboarding

## Living Document

The constitution should:
- Be reviewed quarterly
- Evolve with the team
- Reflect actual practices
- Guide real decisions
- Be actively referenced

## Benefits

- Aligns team expectations
- Reduces decision friction
- Establishes quality bar
