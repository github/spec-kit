# Generate Implementation Plan

Create a detailed implementation plan based on the approved specification.

## Process

1. **Review specification** - Understand requirements thoroughly
2. **Use the template** - Base your plan on `templates/plan-template.md`
3. **Break into phases** - Organize work into logical phases
4. **Identify dependencies** - Map task dependencies clearly
5. **Estimate effort** - Provide realistic time estimates

## Plan Structure

Your plan must include:
- Multiple phases with clear objectives
- Detailed tasks with owners and estimates
- Risk identification and mitigation
- Timeline and resource allocation

## Output

Save the plan to:
```
.plans/<feature-name>-plan.md
```

## Best Practices

- Break work into phases of roughly equal size
- Identify critical path
- Include testing and documentation tasks
- Account for integration and deployment
- Plan for rollback if needed
