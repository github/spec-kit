# Feature: [FEATURE TITLE]

**Parent Idea**: [Link to ../idea.md]
**Feature ID**: ##
**Short Name**: [feature-short-name]
**Priority**: P1/P2/P3
**Status**: Not Specified

<!--
  This feature file is part of a larger idea that has been decomposed
  into smaller, manageable features. Each feature can be specified,
  planned, and implemented independently.

  Use /speckit.specify with this file to create a formal specification.
-->

## Summary

<!--
  Write 2-3 sentences that answer:
  - What is this feature specifically?
  - What value does it provide?
  - Who benefits from it?

  This should be understandable without reading the parent idea.
-->

[2-3 sentences describing this specific feature and its value]

## User Value

<!--
  Be specific about who benefits and how.
  Reference personas from the parent idea.md.
-->

**Who benefits**: [Specific user persona from idea.md]
**What they gain**: [Concrete, measurable benefit]
**Success metric**: [How to measure this feature's success specifically]

## Scope

### This Feature Includes

### This Feature Does NOT Include

<!--
  Explicitly state what is NOT part of this feature:
  - Things that belong to another feature
  - Things that are out of scope entirely
  - Common assumptions that might be wrong
-->

- [Explicitly excluded - may be in another feature]
- [Explicitly excluded - out of scope entirely]

## Key Use Cases

<!--
  List features that MUST be implemented before this one.
  Include what specifically is needed from each.
-->

- [Feature ##]: [What this feature needs from it]
- [Feature ##]: [What this feature needs from it]

### Enables (can be done after)

<!--
  List features that depend on this one.
  Include what this feature provides to each.
-->
