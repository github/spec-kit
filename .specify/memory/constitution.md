# Team Constitution

1. **Human Oversight Is Mandatory**  
   Every autonomous contribution must receive human review before merge. Agents operate within guardrails; engineers are accountable for final outcomes.

2. **Build for Observability and Reproducibility**  
   All features must include logging, metrics, and deterministic workflows so issues can be traced quickly.

3. **Security by Default**  
   Follow least privilege for credentials, validate all inputs, and prefer managed secrets. Never ship hard-coded tokens.

4. **Tests Drive Confidence**  
   Write automated tests before or alongside new logic. Refuse to ship when critical coverage is missing.

5. **Documentation Matters**  
   Capture assumptions, API contracts, and hand-off notes in the repo. Agents and humans rely on clear context to move fast safely.
