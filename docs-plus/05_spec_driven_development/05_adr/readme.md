# Module 05: Architecture Decision Records (ADR) - Post-Planning Review

> **After `/plan` completes, you'll see a suggestion to review for architectural decisions. Run `/adr` to capture significant technical choices before implementation.**

## The Problem: Undocumented Decisions

Teams make critical architectural decisions during planning—database choices, API patterns, security models—but these decisions often live only in chat history or planning docs. When revisited months later:

- **Why questions** have no documented answers
- **Tradeoffs** are forgotten
- **Alternatives** that were considered are lost
- **Context** that influenced the decision is missing

## The Solution: Explicit ADR Review After Planning

ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) capture **why** technical decisions were made, not just **what** was decided. In Spec Kit, ADRs are created **after planning** when you have full context.

### When ADRs Happen

```
/constitution → /specify → /plan 
                              ↓
                   📋 Suggestion appears: "Review for architectural decisions? Run /adr"
                              ↓
                         (You run /adr)
                              ↓
                   ADRs created in docs/adr/
                              ↓
                         /tasks → /implement
```

**Key flow:**
1. Complete planning with `/plan`
2. **PHR automatically created** (planning session documented)
3. **ADR suggestion appears** (automatic reminder)
4. **You explicitly run `/adr`** when ready
5. ADRs created for significant decisions

### Why Explicit, Not Automatic?

ADR creation requires **careful analysis and judgment**. You might need to:
- Discuss decisions with the team first
- Review existing ADRs before creating new ones
- Decide if decisions are truly architecturally significant

The suggestion ensures you don't forget, but you control when it happens.

## What Makes a Decision "Architecturally Significant"?

The `/adr` command uses three criteria (ALL must be true):

### 1. Impacts How Software is Structured
Does this decision change how engineers write, organize, or architect code?

✅ **Yes:** Choosing REST vs GraphQL API  
❌ **No:** Which HTTP client library to use

### 2. Has Notable Tradeoffs or Alternatives
Were alternatives considered? Are there consequences to understand?

✅ **Yes:** PostgreSQL vs MongoDB (different data models, query patterns)  
❌ **No:** Using prettier for formatting (no architectural tradeoff)

### 3. Will Be Questioned or Revisited Later
Will someone ask "why did we do this?" in 6 months?

✅ **Yes:** Microservices vs monolith architecture  
❌ **No:** Naming a helper function

### Examples

**Architecturally Significant (Create ADR):**
- Database choice: PostgreSQL vs MongoDB
- Auth strategy: JWT vs sessions
- API pattern: REST vs GraphQL vs RPC
- Deployment: Serverless vs containers
- State management: Redux vs Context API
- Testing strategy: Unit vs integration focus

**NOT Architecturally Significant (Skip ADR):**
- Variable naming conventions
- Code formatting rules
- Which linter to use
- Specific library versions
- File organization preferences
- Comment style guidelines

## How It Works

### Step 1: Complete Planning

```bash
/plan  # Design your feature architecture
```

You create:
- `specs/001-auth/plan.md` - Main planning document
- `specs/001-auth/research.md` - Research notes (optional)
- `specs/001-auth/data-model.md` - Data models (optional)
- `specs/001-auth/contracts/` - API contracts (optional)

### Step 2: See ADR Suggestion

After `/plan` completes, you see:

```
📋 Planning complete! Review for architectural decisions? Run /adr
```

This happens automatically—no action needed yet.

### Step 3: Run /adr When Ready

When you're ready to review (immediately, or after team discussion):

```bash
/adr  # Analyzes planning artifacts
```

### Step 4: ADR Analysis Workflow

The `/adr` command:

1. **Loads planning context**
   - Reads plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/
   - Understands the feature requirements

2. **Extracts decisions**
   - Identifies technical choices made during planning
   - Examples: "Using PostgreSQL", "JWT authentication", "REST API"

3. **Checks existing ADRs**
   - Reads docs/adr/ to find related decisions
   - Avoids duplicates or superseded decisions

4. **Applies significance test**
   - For each decision, checks all 3 criteria
   - Only proceeds if decision is architecturally significant

5. **Creates ADR files**
   - Generates docs/adr/NNNN-decision-title.md
   - Sequential numbering (0001, 0002, 0003, etc.)
   - Complete ADR template with context, decision, consequences

6. **Shows report**
   - Lists created ADRs
   - Lists referenced ADRs
   - Confirms readiness for /tasks

### Step 5: Review and Proceed

You now have:
- ✅ Planning docs (plan.md, research.md, etc.)
- ✅ PHR of planning session (automatic)
- ✅ ADRs for architectural decisions (explicit via /adr)

Ready for `/tasks` to break down implementation!

## What Each ADR Contains

ADRs are created in `docs/adr/` with sequential numbering:

```
docs/
└── adr/
    ├── 0001-use-postgresql-database.md
    ├── 0002-jwt-authentication-strategy.md
    └── 0003-rest-api-architecture.md
```

Each ADR file contains:

```markdown
# ADR-0002: JWT Authentication Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need secure, stateless authentication for our API...

## Decision
We will use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication...

## Consequences

### Positive
- Stateless authentication (no server-side sessions)
- Works well with microservices
- Industry standard with good library support

### Negative
- Token revocation is complex
- Must manage token refresh carefully
- Token size larger than session IDs

## Alternatives Considered
- Session-based auth (rejected: requires sticky sessions)
- OAuth2 (rejected: overkill for our use case)

## Related
- Spec: specs/001-auth/spec.md
- Plan: specs/001-auth/plan.md
```

## Integrated Workflow

### Full SDD Flow with ADRs

```
1. /constitution
   └─→ PHR created (automatic)

2. /specify
   └─→ PHR created (automatic)

3. /plan
   └─→ PHR created (automatic)
   └─→ 📋 "Review for architectural decisions? Run /adr"

4. /adr  ← YOU RUN THIS
   └─→ ADRs created in docs/adr/
   └─→ Shows report

5. /tasks
   └─→ PHR created (automatic)

6. /implement
   └─→ PHR created (automatic)
```

### ADRs Link Planning to Implementation

- **Spec** (specs/001-auth/spec.md) - WHAT we're building
- **Plan** (specs/001-auth/plan.md) - HOW we'll build it
- **ADR** (docs/adr/0002-jwt-auth.md) - WHY we made key decisions
- **Tasks** (specs/001-auth/tasks.md) - Work breakdown
- **Implementation** - Actual code

ADRs provide the critical **WHY** context that specs and plans don't fully capture.

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Feature (No ADRs Needed)

```bash
/plan  # Design simple CRUD endpoint
# → 📋 Suggestion: "Run /adr"

/adr  # Analyzes planning artifacts
# → "No architecturally significant decisions found. Proceed to /tasks."
```

**Result:** No ADRs created (implementation details don't need ADRs)

### Scenario 2: Complex Feature (Multiple ADRs)

```bash
/plan  # Design new microservice with database and API
# → 📋 Suggestion: "Run /adr"

/adr  # Analyzes planning artifacts
# → Creates:
#    - docs/adr/0005-use-event-sourcing.md
#    - docs/adr/0006-kafka-message-broker.md
#    - docs/adr/0007-graphql-api.md
# → "3 ADRs created. Proceed to /tasks."
```

**Result:** Multiple ADRs for significant architectural choices

### Scenario 3: References Existing ADR

```bash
/plan  # Design feature using existing patterns
# → 📋 Suggestion: "Run /adr"

/adr  # Analyzes planning artifacts
# → "Referenced existing ADRs:
#    - docs/adr/0002-jwt-authentication.md
#    - docs/adr/0003-rest-api-pattern.md
#    No new ADRs needed. Proceed to /tasks."
```

**Result:** No new ADRs (reusing established patterns)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No plan.md found"

**Cause:** Running `/adr` before `/plan`  
**Solution:** Complete planning first: `/plan Design the feature`

### "No architecturally significant decisions found"

**Cause:** Planning contains only implementation details  
**Solution:** Normal! Not every feature needs ADRs. Proceed to `/tasks`

### Too Many ADRs Created

**Cause:** Including implementation details in planning  
**Solution:** Focus planning on architecture, not code-level decisions

### ADR Duplicates Existing ADR

**Cause:** Didn't reference existing patterns  
**Solution:** Review docs/adr/ before planning new features

---

## Best Practices

### Do Create ADRs For:
✅ Technology choices (databases, frameworks, platforms)  
✅ Architectural patterns (microservices, event-driven, layered)  
✅ Security models (auth strategies, encryption approaches)  
✅ API contracts (REST vs GraphQL, versioning strategies)  
✅ Data models (normalization, schema design)  
✅ Infrastructure decisions (deployment patterns, scaling strategies)

### Don't Create ADRs For:
❌ Code style and formatting  
❌ Library choices (unless architectural impact)  
❌ Variable/function naming  
❌ Implementation algorithms  
❌ Testing implementation details  
❌ Documentation formats

### When in Doubt:
Ask: "Will someone question this decision in 6 months?"  
- **Yes** → Create ADR  
- **No** → Skip ADR

## Summary

ADRs capture the **why** behind architectural decisions:

✅ **Automatic suggestion** after `/plan` - Never forget to review  
✅ **Explicit execution** via `/adr` - You control timing  
✅ **Significance test** - Only creates ADRs for important decisions  
✅ **Sequential numbering** - Consistent IDs (0001, 0002, 0003, etc.)  
✅ **Location** - All ADRs in docs/adr/ (centralized)  
✅ **Full context** - Links to specs, plans, alternatives, consequences  
✅ **Team alignment** - Documented decisions reduce debate

### Key Workflow:

1. Complete `/plan` → Suggestion appears
2. Run `/adr` when ready → ADRs created (if significant)
3. Proceed to `/tasks` → Implementation breakdown

**Remember:** ADRs are for architecture, not implementation. Focus on decisions that:
- Change how code is structured
- Have notable tradeoffs
- Will be questioned later
