# Feature Specification: GitHub MCP Integration for Spec-Driven Development

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a developer using the Spec-Driven Development framework, I want GitHub integration throughout the workflow so that specifications become tracked issues, planning creates draft PRs with plan content, tasks update PR descriptions with checkboxes, and implementation automatically updates the project constitution, enabling complete traceability from idea to delivery while keeping documentation synchronized.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer runs `/specify` with a feature description, **When** the specification is created, **Then** a GitHub issue is automatically created with the spec content starting from "Primary User Story", appropriate type icon, and labels (`Specification` + type-based label like `Minor`), and the feature branch is mentioned in the issue description.
2. **Given** a specification issue exists, **When** the developer runs `/plan`, **Then** a draft Pull Request is created with the plan.md document in its description, linking to the issue with "Fixes #<issue-number>", the issue label is updated from `Specification` to `Plan`, and all design artifacts are committed and pushed.
3. **Given** a draft PR exists with a plan, **When** the developer runs `/tasks`, **Then** the PR description is updated to include the tasks.md content with checkboxes for each task phase.
4. **Given** a PR with tasks listed, **When** the developer runs `/implement` and completes tasks, **Then** the PR description is progressively updated with checkmarks as each task section completes, the PR is marked as ready for review (no longer draft), the issue label is updated to `Implementation`, and the project constitution is updated with the newly implemented functionality.
5. **Given** all commands use AI-powered branch name generation, **When** `/specify` analyzes a feature description, **Then** the AI generates a concise, kebab-case branch name (2-4 words) capturing the core concept before the feature number is prepended.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when GitHub API is unavailable during issue/PR creation?
- How does the system handle conflicts when updating existing PRs?
- What if a developer manually changes issue labels - should the workflow detect and warn?
- How does constitution update handle merge conflicts if multiple features update it simultaneously?
- What happens if `/implement` is run before `/tasks` completes?
- How are partial task completions tracked if `/implement` is interrupted mid-execution?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST update `templates/commands/specify.md` to include AI-generated branch name creation and GitHub issue creation with formatted title (icon + type + description), spec content starting from "Primary User Story" section as body (removing the first two headers), appropriate labels in code format with backticks, and feature branch mentioned in description.
- **FR-002**: System MUST update `templates/commands/plan.md` to include Git commit/push operations, draft PR creation with plan.md document content in the description, issue linking with "Fixes #<issue-number>", PR description formatting, label application, and issue label updates (remove `Specification`, add `Plan`).
- **FR-003**: System MUST update `templates/commands/tasks.md` to include PR description update functionality that appends the tasks.md content with checkboxes for each task phase to the existing PR description.
- **FR-004**: System MUST update `templates/commands/implement.md` to include progressive PR description updates with checkmarks as task sections complete, PR status update (draft ‚Üí ready for review), issue label update (add `Implementation`), and constitution update with newly implemented functionality.
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure `/specify` command generates branch names using AI analysis of the feature description, extracting 2-4 core words in kebab-case format before the feature number prefix is applied.
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide consistent PR title formatting across all phases using pattern: `<Icon> [Type]: <Description>` where icons are üìñ (Docs), ü™≤ (Fix), ‚ö†Ô∏è (Security fix), ü©π (Patch), üöÄ (Feature/Minor), üåü (Breaking change/Major).
- **FR-007**: System MUST ensure PR descriptions follow format: leading summary paragraph without title, plan.md content section, tasks.md content section with checkboxes, ending with "- Fixes #<issue-number>" line, followed by additional context (Why, How, What) without superfluous headers.
- **FR-008**: System MUST apply semantic labels to issues and PRs using code formatting with backticks: type-based labels (`Docs`, `Fix`, `Patch`, `Minor`, `Major`) and phase-based labels (`Specification`, `Plan`, `Implementation`).
- **FR-009**: System MUST update the project constitution document during `/implement` phase to include details about the newly implemented functionality, maintaining the constitution as the single source of truth for project capabilities.
- **FR-010**: System MUST synchronize both `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md` (GitHub Copilot-specific) and `templates/commands/*.md` (generic agent templates) to have consistent GitHub MCP integration behavior.
- **FR-011**: System MUST update `templates/spec-template.md` to match `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` structure with User Scenarios & Testing section first, followed by Requirements section.
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide error handling and rollback mechanisms when GitHub API operations fail during any phase of the workflow.
- **FR-013**: System MUST document the GitHub MCP workflow and integration patterns in appropriate documentation files for future maintainers and contributors.

### Key Entities

- **GitHub Issue**: Represents a feature specification in GitHub's issue tracking system. Contains spec title, description (spec.md content starting from Primary User Story), labels indicating phase and type formatted with backticks, and mentions the feature branch in description text.
- **Pull Request (Draft)**: Created during `/plan` phase. Links to issue, contains plan.md document in description, all design artifacts committed (plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/), marked as draft to indicate work in progress.
- **Pull Request (with Tasks)**: Updated during `/tasks` phase. Description now includes both plan.md and tasks.md content with checkboxes for each task phase, still in draft status.
- **Pull Request (Ready)**: Updated during `/implement` phase. Description shows progressive checkmarks as task sections complete, no longer draft, contains all implementation changes, links to issue with "Fixes" keyword, ready for code review and merge.
- **Feature Branch**: Git branch named with format `###-kebab-case-name` where ### is auto-incremented feature number and name is AI-generated from feature description.
- **Issue/PR Labels**: GitHub labels formatted with backticks tracking workflow phase (`Specification`, `Plan`, `Implementation`) and change type (`Docs`, `Fix`, `Patch`, `Minor`, `Major`) for semantic versioning and filtering.
- **Constitution Document**: The `.specify/memory/constitution.md` file containing the authoritative record of all project principles, capabilities, and implemented features, updated during `/implement` phase with new functionality.

**Feature Branch**: `001-github-mcp-integration`
**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Add GitHub MCP integration to the execution of the framework. Check the files in .github/prompts and the files in .specify/templates to see how I have altered how to use the process. 1. Constitution = the main artifact that contains the entire info about what this project is about. This is the most important doc. Nothing has really changed on this phase. 2. When running /specify the process builds a specification where the order of the template focusses on the userstory first, and then adds the details later in the docs. This is done as it will create an issue at the end of the process using GitHub MCP. Also updated the prompt to generate the branch name based on the AIs own understanding of the initial spec description. Add more details on what I suggest to update (diff the .github/prompts/specify.prompt.md and templates/commands/specify.md). 3. When /plan is run, i have also done updates in the template and the prompt. diff these and find what i have done differently. 4. Check the other prompts and templates and see what i have done differently. The goal is to build the process into using the GitHub MCP. The goal is to have a process where a spec = an issue with a status (labels) showing whats happening. We also want to use PR (in draft) so that we have a process going from plan -> implement. The process updates the status of the issue during the process. When we are on implement, the important part is that the constitution is updated with the newly added functionality."

## Success Criteria

This feature will be considered successful when:

1. All generic agent templates in `templates/commands/*.md` include GitHub MCP operations matching the GitHub Copilot-specific versions in `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md`
2. Running `/specify` creates both a spec.md file AND a GitHub issue with proper formatting, labels with backticks, and feature branch mentioned
3. Running `/plan` creates design artifacts, commits/pushes them, creates a draft PR with plan.md in description, and updates issue labels
4. Running `/tasks` updates the PR description to append tasks.md content with checkboxes
5. Running `/implement` progressively updates PR checkmarks, marks PR as ready for review, and updates the project constitution with implemented functionality
6. The workflow provides clear error messages and handles GitHub API failures gracefully
7. Documentation clearly explains the GitHub MCP integration for all supported AI agents
8. The spec template structure prioritizes user scenarios before requirements in all templates
9. Issue labels are consistently formatted with backticks throughout all documentation and prompts

## Out of Scope

- Automated merge of PRs after approval (remains manual decision)
- Retroactive conversion of existing features to use GitHub issues/PRs
- Integration with project management tools beyond GitHub (Jira, Linear, etc.)
- Custom GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing/deployment
- Multi-repository support for monorepo structures
- Automatic semantic versioning based on PR labels (future enhancement)
